"New York Rich"
=============

[Jordan Weissman](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/29/income_distribution_of_new_york_city_what_does_it_take_to_be_rich.html?wpsrc=fol_fb) made suspect dataviz choices and displayed separate sideways histograms to show the difference between NYC income distribution and the US and San Francisco income distribution and the US. This is confusing when one of his points is comparing NYC and SF.

Data are the [2012 one-year American Community Survey public use microdata files](http://www2.census.gov/acs2012_1yr/pums/)
